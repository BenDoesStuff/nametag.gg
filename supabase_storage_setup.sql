-- Step 1: Create avatars bucket (do this in Supabase Dashboard > Storage)
-- Go to Supabase Dashboard > Storage > Create bucket
-- Bucket name: "avatars"
-- Public bucket: true (so images can be accessed via URL)

-- Step 2: Set up storage policies (run this in SQL Editor)
-- Create policy to allow authenticated users to upload their own avatars
